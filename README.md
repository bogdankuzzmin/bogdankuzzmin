<p>
I’m a Frontend Developer with 5+ years of experience building complex, high-performance web applications and internal products used by real teams every day.
</p>

<p>
I specialize in designing scalable frontend architectures, rich data-driven interfaces, and responsive user experiences. Most of my work is within the React ecosystem, where I build everything from reusable UI systems to large feature modules with real-time updates and complex business logic.
</p>

<p>
In addition to frontend development, I also work at the backend-for-frontend layer using Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. This allows me to design features end-to-end — from database models and API routes to performant, user-friendly interfaces.
</p>

<p>
I have strong experience working on high-load and data-heavy systems, including sports analytics platforms and enterprise internal tools. My focus is not just on building interfaces, but on delivering maintainable, well-structured solutions that scale with the product.
